# SonicSpriterZ
Project Dash: Sonic Sprite Fighter (PC first then Port to Vita via VitaSDK)
DBFZ Inspired Fighting Game with Sprite of GameBoy Advance Sonic Characters 
with sprites from the following games
Base: Sonic Battle and Sonic Advance 1,2,3
(Future - Episode BlackDoomX: Megaman X Series, Megaman Series, Sonic 1,2,3,CD)

Vertical Slice
1) Gather Libraries and Set up MSVS Project:
	- SFML: Simple and Fast Multimedia Libary handles graphics, input, and audio
	- SDL2: Simple DirectMedia Layer - handles creation, rendering, and input

2) Visuals and Gameplay
	- Read input from the user (Keyboard initial priority, then FightStick, then gamepad...)
	- Show effect of input in game (moving image within window etc.)
	
2) Use Box2D for hitboxes and hurtboxes
	- Hitboxes must match dimensions of character sprites (sketch on iPad)
	- Low hitboxes will need to be made (take from x4-x8 and Procreate for Sonic Characters or find 'look-down' animations/sheets)

3) Sprite Management - manage with libraries like STB Image or SFML built-in's
	- Went with SFML -> Statically Linked so must add Licence for library software

4) State Management for movement
	- Use Finite State Machines for movement, attacks, hit-detection and specials and supers???

Environment:
-Tools: SFML/SDL2 (Libraries, Compiler, IDE)
-MSVS Empty Project and Link to graphics library
-create c++ file
-get a window and go...
